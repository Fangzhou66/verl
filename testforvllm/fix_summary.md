# vLLM TPU Test Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis

The test was failing with a segfault when trying to run vLLM with Qwen3-8B on TPU. By comparing with the user's working `vllm serve` command, I identified several key configuration differences.

## Key Differences Found

### 1. **VLLM_USE_V1 Environment Variable**
- **Working command**: Not explicitly set (defaults to `1` in vLLM)
- **Failing test**: Explicitly set to `0`
- **Impact**: The user's output showed "Using V1 engine", but the test was forcing V0

### 2. **XLA_USE_SPMD Environment Variable**
- **Working command**: Not set
- **Failing test**: Explicitly set to `0`
- **Impact**: May interfere with TPU initialization

### 3. **max_model_len Parameter**
- **Working command**: 32768
- **Failing test**: 4096
- **Impact**: Likely not the cause of segfault, but should match for consistency

## The Fix

### Changes Made to test_verl_vllm_qwen3_simple.py:

1. **Removed explicit environment variable settings**:
   ```python
   # Before:
   os.environ["XLA_USE_SPMD"] = "0"
   os.environ["VLLM_USE_V1"] = "0"
   
   # After:
   # Don't set XLA_USE_SPMD - let it use defaults
   # Don't set VLLM_USE_V1 - let it use default value of 1
   ```

2. **Updated max_model_len to match**:
   ```python
   # Before:
   max_model_len=4096,
   
   # After:
   max_model_len=32768,  # Match working vllm serve configuration
   ```

### Created Alternative Fixed Test

Also created `test_verl_vllm_qwen3_fixed.py` with the corrected configuration that matches the working setup.

## Why This Matters

1. **V1 vs V0 Engine**: vLLM's V1 engine is the default and has better TPU support
2. **Environment Variables**: Forcing non-default values can cause initialization issues
3. **Configuration Consistency**: Matching the working configuration ensures compatibility

## Verification

The working command that the user confirmed works:
```bash
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-8B --device tpu --tensor-parallel-size 8 --dtype bfloat16 --max-model-len 32768 --download-dir /tmp/models --swap-space 32 --disable-log-stats --trust-remote-code --enforce-eager
```

This uses V1 engine by default (VLLM_USE_V1=1) and doesn't override XLA_USE_SPMD.

## Next Steps

Run the fixed test to verify it works without segfault:
```bash
cd /home/fangzhou/verl/testforvllm
python test_verl_vllm_qwen3_simple.py
```
